Troubleshooting Notes (write in report)
While setting up, the original requirements file failed to install psutil==5.8.0 and typed-ast on Python 3.12. I resolved this by upgrading psutil to a newer version and installing a modern black package. Additionally, the pinned pytest==6.2.2 was incompatible with Python 3.12, so I upgraded pytest to the latest version. After these fixes, the tests ran successfully and the application was accessible via my local IP on port 5004.

Troubleshooting Steps

Installed updated versions of psutil, black, and pytest for Python 3.12 compatibility.

Verified app entrypoint and ran Flask with --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5004.

Confirmed accessibility both via 127.0.0.1 and local IP address.
